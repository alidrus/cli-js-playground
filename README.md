# cli-js-playground
This is where I test javascript code snippets and javascript libraries via the
command line. It is quite literally a playground. Nothing here is intended for
distribution although, in the spirit of sharing information with others, you
are free to use the code in any way you that you please.

# Requirements
`yarn` or `npm`

# Installation
Install dependencies with:
```bash
yarn
```
or
```bash
npm install
```

# How to run the scripts?
After [installation](#Installation), you may run any of the scripts as follows:
```bash
./run <script.js>
```

# Precautions (and Disclaimer)
Always check any script you download before running it on the command line. I
do not hold any responsibility for any damage you could potentially do to your
system by running these scripts.
